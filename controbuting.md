# Feature Requests:

If you have ideas for new features or improvements, feel free to submit a GitHub issue with a clear description of the feature and its use case.

# Code Contributions: 

You can contribute to PythonicOS by implementing new features, fixing bugs, or improving the existing codebase. See the next sections for more details on getting started and our development workflow.

# Getting Started
To get started with PythonicOS development, follow these steps:

#### Fork the PythonicOS repository to your GitHub account.
#### Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
#### Set up the development environment by following the instructions in the README.md file.
#### Familiarize yourself with the codebase and the project structure.
#### Check the existing issues and pull requests to see if there are any tasks you'd like to work on or if your idea has already been discussed.
#### Create a new branch for your contribution. Use a descriptive name that summarizes your work (e.g., feature/new-feature or bugfix/issue-123).
#### Make your changes, following the coding guidelines described below.
#### Write tests to ensure the stability of your changes and cover edge cases whenever possible.
#### Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.
#### Push your branch to your forked repository.
#### Open a pull request against the master branch of the original PythonicOS repository.
#### Monitor the feedback and address any requested changes or comments.
#### Development Workflow


# We follow a typical GitHub workflow for managing contributions. Here's an overview of the steps involved:

#### Select an issue or create a new one if needed. If you're working on a larger feature or major change, it's a good practice to discuss it first by creating a GitHub issue or reaching out to the project maintainers.

#### Fork the repository and create a new branch for your contribution.

#### Make your changes, following the coding guidelines.

#### Ensure that your code builds successfully and passes all the tests.

#### Commit your changes with clear and descriptive messages. If your changes address an existing issue, reference it in the commit message (e.g., "Fixes #123").

#### Push your branch to your forked repository.

#### Open a pull request against the master branch of the original PythonicOS repository.

#### Engage in discussions with the maintainers and address any feedback or requested changes.

#### Once your changes have been reviewed and approved, they will be merged into the main codebase.

# Coding Guidelines

#### To maintain a consistent codebase, please adhere to the following coding guidelines:

#### Write clear, concise, and self-explanatory code with meaningful variable and function names.

#### Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.

#### For C code, follow the Linux kernel coding style.

Write comprehensive tests to cover your changes and ensure the stability of the codebase.

Document your code and provide necessary comments to make it easier for others to understand your work.

Submitting a Pull Request

To submit a pull request, follow these steps:

Ensure that your code is ready for review and that all tests pass successfully.

Make sure your branch is up to date with the latest changes from the master branch of the original repository.

Give your pull request a descriptive title and provide a clear summary of the changes you made.

Reference any relevant issues or pull requests in the description, using the appropriate keywords (e.g., "Fixes #123").

Be responsive to any feedback or comments during the review process.

Once your changes have been reviewed and approved, they will be merged into the main codebase.
